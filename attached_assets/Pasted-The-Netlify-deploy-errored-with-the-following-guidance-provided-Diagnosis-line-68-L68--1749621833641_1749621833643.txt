The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
[line 68](#L68): The build failed with a non-zero exit code: 2 due to an error in the build script. Specifically, there is a ReferenceError in the file "build-netlify.js" stating "require is not defined in ES module scope."

### Solution
1. Update the "build-netlify.js" file to use `import` instead of `require` since the file is being treated as an ES module.
2. Verify that the package containing the necessary modules is in the `package.json` file or was committed to the repository.

By updating the file to use `import` and verifying the package, you should be able to resolve the ES module scope error in the build script.
